	<h1>Teach4DH Submission</h1>
	      
	      <h2>Electronic submission</h2>
      
	      <p>Submission is electronic, using the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=teach4dh">EasyChair conference management system</a>.

	      <h2>Submission and Reviewing</h2>
	     <p>We invite long and short papers:
		<ul>
			<li> Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references.</li> 
			<li> Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited references.</li>
	      </ul>
	      
	      <p>Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop 
co-chairs (teach4dh@googlegroups.com). Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper
is withdrawn for any reason.
	      </p>

	        <h2>Format</h2>
Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include authors’ names and affiliations or self-references 
that reveal the authors’ identity -- e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." should be replaced by citations 
such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.
	      </p>	    
	     <p>
	       Submissions must be in PDF. For templates and style files see the GSCL 2017 conference: <a href="http://gscl2017.dfki.de/callPapers.php">http://gscl2017.dfki.de/callPapers.php</a>. 
	       </p>
	  <!--  <h2>Final submission (camera ready versions of accepted papers)</h2>

<p>For your final paper submissions, again use the style and format as required
by GSCL 2017, and when converting to PDF, make sure that the fonts are
embedded.</p>

<p>We allow one additional page to address reviewers' comments. Long paper
submissions must follow the two-column format of the GSCL 2017 proceedings
without exceeding nine (9) pages of content. References do not count against
this limit. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of
the GSCL 2017 proceedings, and must not exceed five (5) pages. References do not
count against this limit.</p> -->
	      <p>
		      If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the workshop co-chairs.
